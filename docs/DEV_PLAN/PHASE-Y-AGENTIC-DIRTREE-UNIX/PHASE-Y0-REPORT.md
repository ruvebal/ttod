# PHASE-Y0-REPORT.md

**Status:** VERIFYING — no self-certified DONE; awaiting cold review + legibility test
**Runbook:** [`PHASES/Y0-criteria-and-readme.md`](PHASES/Y0-criteria-and-readme.md)
**Branch:** `agentic/dear-tree-tidy`

## What was done

1. Plan audit first (commit `725798a5`): nine inconsistencies fixed — see INDEX § Plan audit.
2. `agentic/ide-mcp/PACK.md` added (new file). Closes the gap Phase W's AG6 left: the criteria
   say a pack has a `PACK.md`, and `ide-mcp/` was the named example without one.
3. `agentic/README.md` rewritten around one legend: pack / leaf rule / leaf skill / landing,
   placement answers ("where do I add…"), the never-rename rule, the byte-copy exception for
   `.cursor/mcp.json`, a live table of what exists, and an honesty section. Role labels replace
   the `~/src/…` paths.
4. Three epigraphs, each verified live:
   - `arch-001`, `arch-014` — compared byte-for-byte against `ttod.yml` (both present verbatim).
   - Raymond — cite reproduced with `ahmes query --cite` on node `0142aef3-…`: `(Raymond 2001, 42)`,
     `scheme=pdf_order`, `evaluator_safe=yes`. Quote text read from the vault's `fission_node`
     row, not from a vector snippet. The tool's page number is **PDF order**, so the README says
     "PDF p. 42" rather than passing it off as a print page (the DevIAC guide's anchor map notes
     print ≈ PDF − 12).

## Evidence

- `check_public_privacy.py agentic/README.md agentic/ide-mcp/PACK.md` → PASS (main's README
  failed at line 20; that finding is closed).
- Relative link targets in the README exist.
- `lao-tzu-tao-compose/` deliberately **not** committed (10 tilde-path findings; owner decision).

## Open for the reviewers

- Legibility test (CASCADE § Legibility test) — run by a reader given only the README and
  `find agentic -maxdepth 2`.
- Cold acceptance review of this report.
