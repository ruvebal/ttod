# Generates skeleton/ts5-fresh-history: a brand-new orphan root commit (no shared Git objects,
# remotes, or history with `main`) containing exactly what a student needs to run the app and
# complete their assignment — nothing from the instructor's internal dev-plan, worktree paths, or
# machine names.
#
# Scope decided per docs/DEV_PLAN/PHASE-U-FEII-TEACHING-SKELETON-CASCADE.md's own TS5 definition:
# "Create a new-history artifact containing the governed core, backend walking skeleton, R3a shell,
# and TS3/TS4 hello-world slices. Include only the assignment briefs, student guide, licenses, and
# public-safe documentation needed for the course." This script IS that decision, explicit and
# re-runnable — an allowlist of what's copied IN, not a denylist of what's deleted, because starting
# from nothing and adding only what's named is the only way an orphan commit can't accidentally
# carry something forgotten.
#
# Source: skeleton/ts5-hello-world (the merge-assembled minimum exit — see PHASE-U-TS5-REPORT.md).
# Never touches main. Never pushes. Safe to re-run (refuses if the target branch already exists).

# Usage: bash scripts/generate-ts5-teaching-baseline.sh

3. A **human** reviews, then `proposal import` → `proposal accept --reviewer-id …` (or ttod-bridge accept path when wired).

Never parse `ttod.yml` ad hoc — go through `cli.py` or `ttod_core` so schema and digest logic stay
in one place.

   `.github/workflows/proposal-accept.yml` computes the `ttod.yml` diff — a second human approval

# 道 THE TAO OF THE DEVELOPMENT (TTOD) — FE II teaching baseline

This is the **hello-world teaching skeleton**, not the instructor's rich reference. Every seam
(content, graph, oracle, PWA, auth, testing) is present end to end but deliberately incomplete —
your assignment is the gap between what runs and what a finished feature would do. Each module
names its own acceptance criteria in its `ASSIGNMENT.md`:

- `services/frontend/src/pages/[locale]/wisdom/ASSIGNMENT.md` — content, i18n, proposals UI
- `services/frontend/src/components/graph/ASSIGNMENT.md` — knowledge graph
- `services/frontend/src/components/oracle/ASSIGNMENT.md` — Oracle terminal
- `services/frontend/public/ASSIGNMENT.md` — PWA & local operations
- `services/frontend/src/auth/ASSIGNMENT.md` — auth, favorites library, public API
- `services/frontend/ASSIGNMENT-testing.md` — testing strategy

## Start here

- [`docs/public/teaching/index.md`](docs/public/teaching/index.md) — how this maps to FE II
  Units 1–7, and how a class session runs (theory → team meeting → lab time)
- [`docs/public/audiences/students.md`](docs/public/audiences/students.md) — what you're expected
  to build and defend
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — the governed-data contract: how quote proposals get reviewed and
  accepted, and the one rule that never changes — only a named human accepts a proposal into
  `ttod.yml`

## Run it locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in required values
make up                # starts backend, MCP, frontend, and the app's own Ollama
```

See `Makefile` (`make help`) for the full command list — validation, tests, local dev servers.

## Contributing

Every PR follows [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md) — it's
your module's grading rubric as a checklist, not a separate hoop. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is
the required check your PRs run against.

Orphan root commit. Generated by scripts/generate-ts5-teaching-baseline.sh
from skeleton/ts5-hello-world's tree — governed core, the working app
(backend/mcp/frontend with every module's ASSIGNMENT.md), local-operation
config, licenses, the agent contract, the reviewer/student PR workflow, and
curated student-facing docs (docs/public/teaching, docs/public/audiences/
students.md, es/ mirrors) only. No docs/DEV_PLAN, no instructor tooling, no
