# Proposal — TTOD Oracle Platform (Front-End II) as a documented cohort case study

**From:** Rubén Vega Balbás, PhD · Prof. Desarrollo Web Front-End I/II · UDIT
**To:** co-investigator (research design/qualitative methods) · Front-End II degree
coordination · UDIT academic direction
**Date:** 2026-09-04 · **Academic year affected:** 2026-27
**Sibling document:** [`RESEARCH-LINE.md`](RESEARCH-LINE.md) (full episteme, RQs, methodology,
risk register, venue ladder — this document does not repeat it)

---

## 1. The request, in one sentence

Authorization for Front-End II's 2026-27 delivery — specifically the 7-student cohort building
the **TTOD Oracle Platform** as Entrega 1 — to constitute a documented case study, with informed
consent, external custody of research data, and output at CER conferences/journals, **without
changing the teaching that would happen anyway.**

---

## 2. The gap

Summarized here; full evidentiary treatment (and the caveat that it needs a fresh vault pull
before external citation) is in [`RESEARCH-LINE.md`](RESEARCH-LINE.md) §0. Two threads: an
inherited, field-level gap (front-end/interface-layer pedagogy under ambient AI is thin in the
literature relative to general programming/data science), and a gap original to this cohort
(documented, cold-review-gated, cascade-orchestrated team development has no evident CER
literature home at all).

---

## 3. Why this cohort, and not a synthetic one

1. **The deliverable already exists and is already graded.** Entrega 1 — Astro islands, i18n,
   testing, CI/CD, AI-assisted code review — is FE II's own Week 7/October 2026 requirement (25%
   of the grade). No measurement demand was added for the study's sake.
2. **The development method is self-documenting.** Every build phase closes with a report, every
   report closes with an independent cold review (`PHASE-R-...-CASCADE-PROMPT.md` §6.1). This
   produces a dated, falsifiable process trace that a conventional team project does not generate.
3. **The cohort is small and bounded (n=7).** This closes the door to statistical inference and
   opens a longitudinal, depth-first case-study design where every trajectory is knowable.
4. **The platform already carries a governed development history.** `ttod.yml`'s own schema and
   tooling went through a fully reported, phase-gated programme (Phase Q, complete 2026-08-18)
   before this cohort touched it — the cohort extends a disciplined codebase, which is a variable
   worth naming, not hiding.

**To confirm before this proposal is finalized:** whether the 2026-27 FE II cohort spans both the
Full-Stack and Data Science & AI degrees, as in prior cycles of this course, or Full-Stack only
this year (affects `RESEARCH-LINE.md` RQ2's answerability, not the rest of the design).

## 4. The artifacts are versioned and auditable

Unlike many teaching-innovation proposals, the object of study is already version-controlled and
auditable in a private instructor repository. Publication or student distribution remains a
separate, gated action:

| Artifact | Where |
| --- | --- |
| TTOD repository (code + governed quote database) | this repository, MIT (code) / CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (content) |
| Development cascade plan, all phase runbooks and reports | `docs/DEV_PLAN/PHASE-R-TTOD-ORACLE-PLATFORM-CASCADE-PROMPT.md` and `docs/DEV_PLAN/PHASES/R*.md` (generated per that document's §0) |
| Testing-strategy deliverable | `docs/testing-strategy.md` (produced by R7, per FE II Unit 5's own required shape) |
| Course track and grading structure | `web-atelier-udit/.../tracks/en/udit/2627-feii/` |

**Consequence for coordination:** authorized reviewers can verify the proposal before approval.
The recorded code/content licenses permit a future publication path, but reproducibility by third
parties and any open-education nomination require a sanitized artifact to be published first;
neither is asserted as complete here.

---

## 5. What is asked of each party

**Of the co-investigator:**

- Design and validate research instruments (entry/exit survey, semi-structured interview guide,
  focus group).
- Lead qualitative analysis of the AI-use-declaration corpus (RQ4) — the discourse-analysis
  competence a CS-only author does not bring.
- **Independent custody of consent and data.** This resolves the teacher/researcher conflict of
  interest and cannot sit with the instructor.

**Of Front-End II degree coordination:**

- Conformity for the subject to operate as a documented case study under informed consent.
- Liaison with UDIT's data-protection officer.
- Recognition of the associated research time.

**Explicitly not requested:** no change to the FE II syllabus, no added mandatory workload for
the cohort, no grade conditioned on research participation.

## 6. Consent taxonomy

Four distinct consents, each with different legal weight — administered by the co-investigator,
never by the instructor:

| # | Consent | Object | Nature and safeguard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C1** | Secondary research use of evidence already produced for grading | Commits/PRs, AI-use declarations, `PHASE-Rx-REPORT.md` cold-review findings, `docs/testing-strategy.md`, oral-defence rubric scores | Opt-in. These artifacts are produced regardless, to be graded; consent covers pseudonymised reuse for research. |
| **C2** | New instruments | Survey, interview, focus-group data | Independent opt-in from C1. Voluntary, no grade effect, revocable at any time. |
| **C3** | Recording | Oral defence / interviews (voice, possibly image) | Separate, stricter consent; participation without recording remains possible; explicit retention period. |
| **C4** | Diffusion of student artifacts | Repository screenshots, code excerpts, direct quotes | Per-artifact consent, attribution-or-anonymity choice retained by the student author. |

**Non-negotiable safeguards:** administered by the co-investigator, not the instructor; the
instructor is blind to who has and has not consented until grades are filed; pseudonymisation at
source; revocable at any time without academic consequence; data-protection sign-off before any
consented collection begins; a check for any additional safeguard needed given the group's actual
composition (minors, vulnerable students).

> **The risk these safeguards neutralize:** a grader asking the people they grade for data. If
> coordination reviews only one section of this proposal, it should be this one.

## 7. Calendar

Anchored to Phase R's own build calendar (`PHASE-R-...-CASCADE-PROMPT.md` §0.1.6, §9):

| Window | Work |
| --- | --- |
| Sep 2026 | Consent instruments frozen, data-protection sign-off sought, cohort start gate opens (R1/R2/R3a green) |
| Sep–Oct 2026 | Cohort builds R3b–R7; cold-review reports accumulate as they close; Entrega 1 due Week 7/October 2026 |
| Oct–Dec 2026 | Analysis of consented process evidence begins only after grades for the relevant components are filed |
| per `RESEARCH-LINE.md` §6 | Venue submissions, once a draft or dataset exists — not before |

---

## 8. What will and will not be affirmed

Per `RESEARCH-LINE.md` §7: a documented replication of known mechanisms in an under-studied
cohort, plus a first, explicitly-labelled design-principles proposal for the cascade methodology
itself. Not effect sizes, not causality, not a validated framework. Null results are publishable
findings in a documented gap, not a failed study.

---

## 9. Note on teaching load

This proposal must not delay or distort teaching. The build calendar in §7 is the FE II calendar
that would run regardless of this proposal's approval; the only research-specific addition is
consent administration and instrument design, both owned by the co-investigator, not the
instructor. Teaching goes first; research is built on top of it, not the reverse.
